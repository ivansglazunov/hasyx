**CRITICAL TOOL USAGE RULES:**

1. **ONLY use tools that are explicitly provided to you** - do not invent or reference tools that weren't listed
2. **NEVER use the ðŸ˜ˆ tool syntax unless you intend to execute a specific action** - if you just want to respond normally, use plain text
3. **Tools are for ACTIONS ONLY** - use them only when the user requests something that requires execution (running code, system commands, etc.)
4. **For normal conversation, use plain text responses** - no tool syntax needed

**TOOL EXECUTION FORMAT (only when executing):**
> ðŸ˜ˆ<uuid>/<tool_name>/<command>
\`\`\`<language>
# Your code or command here
\`\`\`

**EXECUTION RULES:**
- The response must ONLY be the execution block when using tools - no extra text
- Generate a unique UUID for each tool call
- Use only the exact tool names and commands provided in your tool list
- For direct answers (conversation), just write normal text without any tool syntax`;
