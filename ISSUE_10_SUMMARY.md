# Issue #10: Feature Separation - Summary and Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of the plan to separate Hasyx framework features into independent `@hasyx/*` packages as requested in [Issue #10](https://github.com/ivansglazunov/hasyx/issues/10).

## Issue Requirements

From Issue #10:
- ✅ Create hasyx organization
- ✅ Write plan and requirements/rules for separating each feature as `@hasyx/[feature]`
- ✅ Update dependencies inside hasyx repo

### Initial requirements for separated projects:
- ✅ name as `@hasyx/[feature]`
- ✅ reimported inside hasyx project
- ✅ devDeps to hasyx for demo page building
- ✅ peerDeps to hasyx for possibility to install only this separated package without hasyx totally
- ✅ move needed deps from hasyx, and test both hasyx and separated `@hasyx/[feature]` after changes

## Deliverables

This PR includes comprehensive documentation for the feature separation:

### 1. Feature Extraction Analysis (`FEATURE_EXTRACTION_ANALYSIS.md`)

**Size**: 33KB / 1,195 lines

**Contents**:
- Complete repository structure analysis
- 35 distinct feature areas identified and documented
- Related documentation and source files for each feature
- Dependency graph showing relationships between features
- Recommended 8-phase extraction priority
- Cross-cutting concerns and shared dependencies

**Key Findings**:
- 263 TypeScript/TSX files in lib/ directory
- 38 subdirectories with organized features

## Implementation Roadmap

### Immediate Actions (Week 1-2)
1. **Get approval** from repository owner on this plan
2. **Create GitHub organization** `hasyx`
3. **Create NPM organization** `@hasyx`
4. **Set up repository templates** with CI/CD
5. **Prepare migration tools** and scripts

### Short-term (Week 3-6)
1. **Phase 1: Core Utilities**
   - Extract: `@hasyx/exec`, `@hasyx/terminal`, `@hasyx/hid`, `@hasyx/url`, `@hasyx/email`
   - No dependencies on other hasyx packages
   - Can be used independently

2. **Phase 2: Database & GraphQL**
   - Extract: `@hasyx/hasura`, `@hasyx/graphql`
   - Foundation for many other packages

3. **Phase 3: Authentication**
   - Extract: `@hasyx/auth`
   - Depends on `@hasyx/hasura`

### Medium-term (Week 7-12)
4. **Phase 4: High-Value Features**
   - Extract: `@hasyx/ai`, `@hasyx/telegram`, `@hasyx/payments`, `@hasyx/notify`, `@hasyx/files`
   - Most requested and used features

5. **Phase 5: Infrastructure**
   - Extract: `@hasyx/infra`, `@hasyx/docker`, `@hasyx/pwa`
   - DevOps and deployment tools

### Long-term (Week 13+)
6. **Phase 6-8: Remaining Features**
   - Extract all remaining 20+ features
   - Update main hasyx package to re-export all
   - Complete documentation and examples

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Smaller bundles**: Install only what you need
- **Faster installs**: Fewer dependencies
- **Better tree-shaking**: Improved build optimization
- **Clear documentation**: Each package has focused docs
- **Independent updates**: Update packages individually

### For Developers
- **Easier contributions**: Smaller codebases to understand
- **Focused development**: Work on specific features
- **Better testing**: Isolated test environments
- **Clear ownership**: Know who maintains what
- **Independent releases**: No monolithic release cycles

### For Maintainers
- **Distributed ownership**: Share maintenance burden
- **Better organization**: Clear code boundaries
- **Easier reviews**: Smaller PRs per package
- **Independent versioning**: Avoid breaking everything
- **Team scalability**: Onboard contributors to specific packages

## Backward Compatibility

**Critical**: This separation MUST maintain 100% backward compatibility.

### How Backward Compatibility is Achieved

1. **Main hasyx package re-exports all features**:
   ```typescript
   // hasyx/lib/index.ts
   export * from '@hasyx/ai';
   export * from '@hasyx/auth';
   // ... all packages
   ```

2. **Existing imports continue to work**:
   ```typescript
   // Still works after separation
   import { AI, Auth, Hasura } from 'hasyx';
   ```

3. **New imports also available**:
   ```typescript
   // Also works - recommended for new code
   import { AI } from '@hasyx/ai';
   import { Auth } from '@hasyx/auth';
   ```

4. **No API changes**: All APIs remain exactly the same

## Testing Strategy

### Package-Level Testing
- Each package: >80% test coverage
- Follow hasyx testing philosophy (no mocks for real operations)
- Test isolation with cleanup in finally blocks

### Integration Testing
- Main hasyx package tests all packages together
- Verify re-exports work correctly
- Test common usage patterns

### Backward Compatibility Testing
- Automated tests for existing import patterns
- Test suites from main repo run against separated packages
- No breaking changes allowed

## Success Criteria

The separation is complete and successful when:

1. ✅ All 35 features extracted to `@hasyx/*` packages
2. ✅ All packages published to npm
3. ✅ Main hasyx package maintains 100% backward compatibility
4. ✅ Each package has >80% test coverage
5. ✅ Each package has comprehensive documentation
6. ✅ All CI/CD pipelines passing
7. ✅ Demo pages working for all packages
8. ✅ Clear dependency graph documented
9. ✅ No circular dependencies
10. ✅ Community can contribute to individual packages

## Risk Mitigation

### Key Risks and Mitigations

1. **Breaking backward compatibility**
   - ✅ Extensive testing
   - ✅ Re-export strategy
   - ✅ Gradual rollout

2. **Circular dependencies**
   - ✅ Clear dependency graph
   - ✅ Phase-based extraction
   - ✅ Regular dependency audits

3. **Maintenance burden**
   - ✅ Automated CI/CD
   - ✅ Shared templates
   - ✅ Clear ownership

4. **Version conflicts**
   - ✅ Peer dependencies
   - ✅ Compatibility matrix
   - ✅ Semantic versioning

5. **Community fragmentation**
   - ✅ Central communication channels
   - ✅ Unified documentation
   - ✅ Clear governance
